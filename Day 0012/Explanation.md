# [🔥 Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros 🔥](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-equal-sum-of-two-arrays-after-replacing-zeros)

## 💡 Intuition
When we have zeros in our arrays, we need to replace them with positive integers to achieve equal sums. The brilliant insight here is that zeros give us flexibility to increase an array's sum, but if an array has no zeros, its sum is locked in place! 🔒

## 🚀 Approach
1. First, we calculate two critical values for each array:
   - The current sum of all elements
   - The count of zeros present

2. We then determine the minimum possible final sum for each array by replacing all zeros with 1s (the smallest positive integer).

3. Based on zero distribution, we analyze four strategic cases:
   - ✨ **Both arrays have zeros**: We can always make them equal by cleverly choosing replacement values!
   - 🔄 **Only first array has zeros**: We need to check if its minimum possible sum can reach or exceed the second array's fixed sum.
   - 🔁 **Only second array has zeros**: Similar check for the second array reaching the first array's fixed sum.
   - ⚖️ **Neither array has zeros**: They must already have identical sums, or equality is impossible.

## ⏱️ Complexity
- Time complexity: **O(n + m)** 🏎️ - just one linear pass through each array!
- Space complexity: **O(1)** 💾 - using only constant extra space regardless of input size
